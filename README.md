# NLP-Using-spaCy-for-a-Hotel-Reviews-Data-Set

A Natural Language Processing (NLP) model is developed for a hotel reviews dataset, using spaCy. Each row of this dataset represents one review about the hotel. The number of reviews that are used in this model is 5000. Word frequency analysis is used to check the words that have been repeated in reviews the most. Also, pattern matching is done to see the most repeated adjective and noun combinations. Moreover, the word "bad" is selected and the words that came close to it often are also found.
